# Privacy Policy for Veto

**Effective Date:** February 12, 2026

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Veto. Your privacy is not just a feature; it is the foundation upon which this application is built. This Privacy Policy explains our unwavering commitment to protecting your data by not collecting it in the first place. 

Our guiding principle is simple: **What happens on your phone stays on your phone.**

## 2. The Veto Principle: Zero Data Collection

Veto is architected from the ground up to be a zero-data-collection application. We do not collect, store, track, or transmit any of your personal information. Period.

### What This Means for You:

- **No User Accounts:** Veto does not require you to create an account, sign up, or log in. Your identity remains anonymous.
- **No Personal Information:** We do not ask for, access, or store your name, email address, phone number, contacts, or location.
- **No Server-Side Storage:** Your blocklist, audit log, and usage metrics are stored exclusively on your device and are never uploaded to our servers.

### What We **DO NOT** Collect:

To be perfectly clear, Veto **DOES NOT** have access to, collect, or store any of the following information:

| Data Category | Collection Status | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Personal Identifiers** | 🔴 **Not Collected** | Name, Email, Address, etc. |
| **Your Phone Number** | 🔴 **Not Collected** | We don't know who you are. |
| **Contact List** | 🔴 **Not Collected** | Your contacts are never read or uploaded. |
| **Call Logs** | 🔴 **Not Collected** | Your call history is never accessed. |
| **SMS/Text Messages** | 🔴 **Not Collected** | The content of your messages is never read. |
| **Location Data** | 🔴 **Not Collected** | Your physical location is never tracked. |
| **Usage Analytics** | 🔴 **Not Collected** | We don't track how you use the app. |
| **Device Identifiers** | 🔴 **Not Collected** | Advertising ID, Device ID, etc. |

## 3. How Veto Works Without Your Data

Veto achieves powerful spam blocking through on-device processing and privacy-preserving techniques:

1.  **On-Device Blocklist:** Your personal list of blocked numbers is stored securely in your device's local storage. When a call comes in, the operating system (iOS or Android) checks it against this local list.
2.  **Anonymous Reporting:** When you choose to report a number, the app sends **only the spam phone number** to our backend proxy. This report is completely anonymous and is not linked to you or your device in any way. We use this anonymized data to strengthen our community blocklist.

---

## 4. Data Stored Locally on Your Device

The following data is created and stored exclusively on your device. You have full control over this data and can clear it at any time from the app's Settings screen.

- **Your Blocklist:** The list of phone numbers you have chosen to block.
- **Your Audit Log:** A history of calls and texts that Veto has blocked or that you have reported.
- **Your Usage Metrics:** Aggregate counts of blocked calls and texts, displayed on your dashboard.

This data is sandboxed within the Veto application and is not accessible by other apps, except for the necessary operating system extensions (Call Directory Extension on iOS, Call Screening Service on Android) that perform the blocking.

## 5. Third-Party Services

Veto utilizes one third-party service for its community reporting feature:

- **Call Control API:** When you report a spam number, it is anonymously submitted to the Call Control database to help identify emerging spam campaigns. No personal data is sent with this report. You can review their privacy policy at `https://www.callcontrol.com/privacy-policy`.

We do not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

---

## 6. Your Rights Under GDPR & CCPA

Data privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) grant you rights over your personal data, such as the right to access, correct, or delete it.

Because Veto collects **no personal data**, these rights are inherently fulfilled by our architecture. There is no data to access, correct, or delete from our servers because we do not have any.

---

## 7. Children's Privacy

Veto does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. Our service is designed for adults. If you believe we have inadvertently collected information from a child, please contact us so we can take appropriate action (which, in this case, would be to confirm we have no such data).

---

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by updating the policy within the app and on our website. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
