# Terms of Service for Veto

**Effective Date:** February 12, 2026

Welcome to Veto. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Veto mobile application ("App") and any related services provided by Veto ("we," "us," or "our"). By purchasing, downloading, or using our App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

---

## 1. License and Payment

### 1.1. One-Time Purchase

Veto is offered as a one-time purchase through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Upon payment of the purchase price, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for your personal, non-commercial use on devices that you own or control.

### 1.2. No Subscriptions

Your purchase grants you a perpetual license to the version of the App you purchased, including any minor updates and bug fixes. There are no recurring subscriptions, hidden fees, or in-app purchases required for the core functionality of the App.

## 2. App Functionality

Veto is designed to block and report unwanted spam calls and text messages. Its effectiveness depends on several factors, including:

-   Proper configuration of the App on your device.
-   The accuracy of the phone numbers you add to your blocklist.
-   The data provided by our third-party community blocklist service (Call Control).

While we strive to provide a highly effective service, we do not guarantee that the App will block all unwanted communications.

## 3. Your Responsibilities

As a user of Veto, you agree to the following:

-   **Lawful Use:** You will use the App in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. You will not use the App to block legitimate or emergency service numbers.
-   **Accurate Reporting:** You will make a good-faith effort to report only genuine spam numbers. Abusing the reporting feature may impact the effectiveness of the community blocklist.
-   **Data Backup:** All data, including your blocklist and audit log, is stored locally on your device. We are not responsible for the loss of this data. You are encouraged to use the App's export feature to create backups.
